Good afternoon Omar,

My subsystem is GPS and Motor Control

 - Currently working to get the GPS module to talk with Raspberry Pi
 - Having issues with accessing the GPIO pins from the Pi operating system
 - Plan is to be able to read from the GPIO pins by next week and hopefully have the GPS module talking with PI, if all goes well

I will make these progress reports as short and to the point as possible. However, please let me know if you want/need more info.

Respectfully,
Samuel Roth
